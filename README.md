This repository contains all the data and information about the 2 projects that I completed as an intern in Unified Mentor from 10-05-2024 to 10-06-2024.

# About the Internship:
* Organization: Unified Mentor
* Role: Data Analyst Intern
* Timeline: 10-05-2024 to 10-06-2024
* Number of Projects: 2
* Project Names: Financial Analytics & Budget Sales Analytics

# About the Project:

## Project Name: 
 - Budget Sales Analytics
   
## Introduction:

## Domain:
  - Retail & Sales

## Difficulty Level:
 - Advanced

## Problem Statement:
 - Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it.
Extract various information such as Sales, budget, and variance. You can even compare sales and budgets with various attributes. Extract necessary information about Products and Customers. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard. Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.

## Objective:
- Gathering and cleaning data from multiple sources, including sales transactions, customer interactions, and inventory records.
- Exploring and visualizing data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can provide valuable insights.
- Analyzing customer behavior data to understand preferences, purchase patterns, and lifetime value.
- Implementing recommendation systems and personalized marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement and loyalty.
- Building and deploying machine learning models to forecast sales, demand, and inventory levels.
- Developing predictive models to optimize pricing strategies, identify customer segments, and personalize marketing campaigns.
- Applying optimization techniques to improve supply chain management, logistics, and inventory optimization.
- Identifying opportunities for process improvement and efficiency gains through data-driven analysis.
- Providing actionable insights and recommendations to senior management to support strategic decision-making.
- Communicating findings and recommendations to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.

## Important Metrics to measure:
Metrics will help us measure and evaluate the sales performance, and that can provide quantitative and qualitative information about the sales data. Some of the important metrics to use for our exploratory data analysis are -

* Sales volume - The number of units of a product or service sold.
* Sales revenue/ Total Revenue - The total amount of money received from selling goods or services. It's calculated as `Sales Revenue = Sales Volume * Selling Price`.
* Profit per product - The difference between the selling price and the cost of a product. It's calculated as `Profit per Product = Selling Price - Cost of Goods Sold`.
* Total sales per year/quarter/month - The total sales volume or revenue during a specific time period.
* Total sales per region/state/county/product/channel/teams - The total sales volume or revenue for a specific category.
* Year-Over-Year Growth - The percentage change in a variable over a year. It's calculated as `Year-Over-Year Growth = (Current Year Value - Last Year Value) / Last Year Value * 100%`.
* Sales growth rate - The percentage increase in sales over a specific period. It's calculated as `Sales Growth Rate = (Current Period Sales - Previous Period Sales) / Previous Period Sales * 100%`.
* Sales mix - The proportion of each product sold relative to total sales.
* Sales trends - Patterns or tendencies in sales over a period of time.
* Average order value - The average amount spent each time a customer places an order. It's calculated as `Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Number of Orders`.
* Sales variance - The difference between actual sales and forecasted sales.
* Sales forecast accuracy - The closeness of the forecasted sales to the actual sales. It's calculated as `Sales Forecast Accuracy = 1 - (Absolute Error / Actual Sales)`.

## Data Cleaning:
## Data Exploration: 
## Data Analysis:

### Seasonal patterns:

* How has the **sales revenue trended over time**?
* Do sales exhibit **seasonal trends**? For example, are there spikes during holidays or specific months?
   
### Products:

* Which products are the **best sellers** and **worst sellers** in terms of **revenue**?
* Are there any products that consistently **underperform** in terms of quantity and revenue?

### Companies:

* What are the top 10 companies in terms of overall **revenue**?
* What are the least 10 companies in terms of overall **revenue**?

### Regions:

* Which **regions** exhibit the highest and lowest sales performance?
* Are there any **regional variations** in demand or customer preferences?
* Which **states** exhibit the highest and lowest sales performance?
* Which cities exhibit the highest and lowest sales performance?

### Correlations and causality:
* Are there any **correlations** between regional factors (e.g., population density, economic indicators) and sales performance?
