# About the Project:

## Project Name: Budget Sales Analytics
## Introduction:
## Domain:
  - Retail & Sales

## Difficulty Level:
 - Advanced

## Problem Statement:
 - Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it.
Extract various information such as Sales, budget, and variance. You can even compare sales and budgets with various attributes. Extract necessary information about Products and Customers. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard. Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes
